# Blender_Design
Learned to create a 3D design. A studio object design. 

Made a 3D table with shapes, used a background to show more like a studio room. Used bright colors at the top surface for the shine and hard color for the table's legs. Inserted a light for the brightness and clearity of the object. With simultaneous edit and object mode, the table was designed to view in different render modes. I used the EEVEE mode at samples of 16.
